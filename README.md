# Training-Log
## Introductory Training Log

### who it’s for: 

- younger athletes who are driven to record their training for various reasons.  Could be because they are motivated to be like older kids, could be they like the reward of seeing a chart / graph at the end of the week. 
- athletes transitioning to comp level where a log is a requirement. get into the habit

### why?

- develop good training log habits before they’re required
- understand the link between training and performance at a young age
- there doesn’t seem to be anything out there geared toward kids.
